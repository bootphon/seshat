Manually
--------

This type of install is advised if you're good enough at system administration,
and don't want to have to deal with Docker. It's considerably easier to tweak and customize the install
with this kind of installation.

This install is for a linux environment (it could potentially work on MacOS but has not been thoroughly tested).
We here assume that your system has the following requirements:

* A working python 3.6>= (default Python version on Ubuntu 18.04)
* A working nodeJS 12.3>= install
* A mongoDB 3.6>= install

Moreover, the advised web server to act as a web frontend is **Nginx**.
